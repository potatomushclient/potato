1) Downloading Potato
---------------------
The latest release of Potato's source can be downloaded from 

https://github.com/talvo/potato

You can also check out the source via Git for the latest changes.

Source tarballs, Windows .exe's and MacOS packages can be downloaded
directly from http://potatomushclient.com/downloads/

2) Installing Tcl/Tk
--------------------
Potato requires Tcl/Tk to run. Tcl/Tk 8.6.0 is the recommended minimum
version, as it adds a number of useful new features, though for the time
being, 8.5 still works as well.

  a) Windows
  ----------
  On Windows, the easiest way to install Tcl is ActiveState's ActiveTcl
  (see 'c' below). Alternatively, you can download a Tclkit, a single-file
  Tcl/Tk executable, from http://www.patthoyts.tk/tclkit/win32-ix86/
  Select the highest version number (currently 8.6.7) and download the
  tclkit-gui*.exe file. Place this .exe in the "potato.vfs" directory where 
  this INSTALL file is located.

  b) Linux
  --------
   On Linux, the easiest way to install Tcl/Tk is through your OS's package
   management software. On debian based systems they are probably simply 
   called tcl and tk. If you want ssl support, also install tcl-tls. To 
   support window flashing, you'll also want tcl-dev and tk-dev:

     apt-get install tcl tk
     apt-get install tcl-tls
     apt-get install tcl-dev tk-dev

  On Gentoo they are called tcl and tk. For ssl support the package is 
  dev-tcltk/tls:

     emerge tcl tk
     emerge dev-tcltk/tls
     
  Many Linux package managers still contain Tcl 8.5; in this case, Tcl 8.6
  can be obtained by installing ActiveTcl (see 'c' below).
  
  c) All platforms (Windows, Linux or MacOS X)
  -----------------------------------------------
  You can also obtain ActiveTcl 8.6 for Windows, Linux or MacOS X from
  ActiveState at http://www.activestate.com/activetcl/downloads
  
  ActiveTcl is a full Tcl and Tk installation.
  
  For SSL support, you will need to cd to the tcl/bin directory and run
    teacup install tls
  
  On Windows, Start->Run, "cmd.exe", then
    cd c:\tcl\bin
    teacup install tls

3) Running Potato
-----------------
  a) Windows
  ---------
  If you downloaded the TclKit, simply drag-and-drop "main.tcl" onto the
  TclKit.exe to run.
  If using ActiveTcl, you can just double-click "main.tcl".
  
  b) Linux/MacOS X
  ----------------
    cd potato.vfs
    ./main.tcl
