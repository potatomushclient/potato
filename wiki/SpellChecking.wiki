#summary Spell Checking

=Spell Checking=

Potato currently uses ASpell for spell checking. Currently, spell checking is available on demand via the Edit menu; there is no support for as-you-type spell checking (with the red squiggly underlines).

==Installing ASpell==

===Windows===

On Windows, you'll need to download and install both the *Full Installer* and the *aspell-en.exe* files from the [http://aspell.net/win32/ ASpell Win32 webpage]. After installing both, go to [ConfigurePotato Options â†’ Configure Program], select Misc Settings, and set the ASpell Executable option to the path to your aspell.exe - for me, the path was `C:\Program Files (x86)\Aspell\bin\aspell.exe`. After that, spell checking should be enabled in the Edit menu.

===Linux and Mac OS X===
You can either obtain ASpell from your OS's package manager, or download and compile it yourself from the [http://aspell.net/ ASpell website] (full instructions are available on their site), then set the [ConfigurePotato ASpell Executable] option in Potato to the aspell executable as mentioned above.

If anyone has more detailed instructions for installed ASpell on these platforms, please [ContactMe let me know] and I'll include them here.
