Potato MU`*` Client was written by Mike Griffiths (mike@keyboardzombie.com). Based loosely on earlier code which was originally written by Keith Vetter (Brinli@ElendorMUSH).

  * Some ideas for the telnet processing code were taken from code written by Todd Martin, available from [http://wiki.tcl.tk/5644]
  * The Winflash and Linflash libraries were  written by Youness El Alaoui (!KaKaRoTo - kakaroto@users.sourceforge.net).
  * Potato uses the Winico extension on MS Windows to display an icon in the system tray.
  * The Font Selection dialog (used with Tk 8.5) is based heavily on code written by (a different) Keith Vetter, and is available from [http://wiki.tcl.tk/16074]. Tk 8.6 provides a native dialog.
  * Potato on Linux debugged and tested by Cheetah@M`*`U`*`S`*`H.
  * !MacOS X builds provided by Yuriko@M`*`U`*`S`*`H.

Potato is powered by the Tcl/Tk programming language and several extensions to it, and would not be possible without them.

On MS Windows, Potato includes the Winico extension for Tk, which is available from [http://tktable.sourceforge.net SourceForge]. Winico is used to place an icon in the system tray, and is Copyright Â© 1997-1998, Brueckner&Jarosch.

Translations provided by Stoko (Croatian), Nymeria (Swedish) and Bratto (Spanish).

Winico and Winflash extensions compiled for Potato by Givur.
