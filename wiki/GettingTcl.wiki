#summary Installing Tcl when running from source

= Downloading Tcl =

Potato is written in [http://www.tcl.tk Tcl/Tk], an interpreted language available for many platforms. The [Downloads binary downloads] of Potato include a Tcl interpreter, so you don't need to install one. However, if you're [RunFromSource running Potato from SVN or the source], you'll need a copy of Tcl, too. Potato runs best on Tcl/Tk 8.6, but will also work on Tcl/Tk 8.5. It will *not* run with Tcl/Tk 8.4 or older.

If you're running Windows or MacOS X and don't already have Tcl installed on your system, we recommend you install [http://www.activestate.com ActiveTcl], a full Tcl/Tk install from !ActiveState. This includes everything you need to start using Potato.

When running on Linux, it's generally easier install Tcl and Tk through the OS's package management system. However, if you don't wish to or are unable to, you can download and install [http://www.activestate.com ActiveTcl].
