#summary Download links for Potato

=Downloading Potato=
Because Google Code no longer allows adding new Download files, the latest versions of Potato are available directly from [http://www.potatomushclient.com/downloads/ the Potato Website]. Old versions will be kept on the Google Code site, should you need them.

==Windows==
Potato is available as a single-file .exe for MS Windows (32- and 64-bit).

==Linux==
The easiest way to run Potato on Linux is currently [RunFromSource running from source]. There is no compiling required.

Linux binaries are no longer provided, as they actually proved more troublesome for people to use than the source. However, if you'd like a Linux binary, I can provide them on request.

==MacOS X==

As of version 2.0.0b12, a MacOS X .dmg binary is available. These binaries are provided by Yuriko.

You can also run Potato on the Mac [RunFromSource from SVN, a Starkit or the source].
